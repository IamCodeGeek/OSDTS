# **Amazon Graphic Card Price Tracker**  

## **Introduction**  
This project is a **web scraping-based price tracker** for **Amazon India**, built as part of my **OSDTS (Open Source Development & Tools and Technologies) assignment**. The script fetches **real-time prices** of selected **graphics cards** from Amazon using Python libraries like **Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Schedule**.  

## **Features**  
‚úÖ **Fetches latest product prices from Amazon** üì¶  
‚úÖ **Handles multiple price locations** (main price, hidden price, discounted price) üè∑Ô∏è  
‚úÖ **Avoids bot detection using request headers & delays** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
‚úÖ **Runs automatically at scheduled intervals** using `schedule` ‚è∞  

## **How It Works**  
1. The script sends a request to **Amazon India** with a user-agent to mimic a browser request.  
2. It extracts prices using **BeautifulSoup**, handling different price formats.  
3. The script runs at regular intervals using **`schedule`**, continuously checking for price updates.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python 3**  
- **Requests** (for fetching web pages)  
- **BeautifulSoup** (for parsing HTML)  
- **Schedule** (for automating execution)  

## **How to Use**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-price-tracker.git
   cd amazon-price-tracker
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python amazon_GraphicCardPrice_Tracker.py
   ```
4. The script will **fetch prices and display them in the terminal** at scheduled intervals.
